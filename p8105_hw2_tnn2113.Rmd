This is my solution to HW1.


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 2

Read in the subway dataset and some brief cleaning

```{r}
subway_data = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-(ada_notes:entrance_location))  %>% 
  select(-c("division", "exit_only", "staffing", "staff_hours", "vending")) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, `YES` = "TRUE", `NO` = "FALSE"))
```

After some brief cleaning, the data contains subway line, station name, station latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. `select` function was used to remove the columns after ADA. `select` was then used a gain to remove some unneccessary columns. `mutate` function was used to change from character variable to logical variable. 

The resulting dataset is a tibble of 18 columns and 1,868 rows (1,868 x 18)
