This is my solution to HW2.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 2

Read in the subway dataset and some brief cleaning

``` r
subway_data = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-(ada_notes:entrance_location))  %>% 
  select(-c("division", "exit_only", "staffing", "staff_hours")) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, `YES` = "TRUE", `NO` = "FALSE"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

After some brief cleaning, the data contains subway line, station name,
station latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance
type, and ADA compliance. `select` function was used to remove the
columns after ADA. `select` was then used a gain to remove some
unneccessary columns. `mutate` function was used to change from
character variable to logical variable.

The resulting dataset is a tibble of 19 columns and 1868 rows (1,868 x
18). These data are not tidy.

Subway dataset without `entrance type`, `entry`, and `vending`

``` r
subway_df = select(subway_data, -(entrance_type:vending))
```

Number of distinct subway stations

``` r
subway_data_tidy = 
  distinct(subway_df)
```

There are 477 distinct stations.

Number of stations are ADA compliant

``` r
subway_ada_compliant = filter(subway_data_tidy, ada == TRUE)
```

There are 94 stations that ADA compliant.

Proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allowance

``` r
subway_no_vending = filter(subway_data, vending == "NO")
subway_no_vending_distinct = distinct(subway_no_vending, line, station_name, vending)
```

Proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allowance is 99.

``` r
subway_reformat = 
  gather(subway_data_tidy, `route1`:`route11`, key = "route", value = "subway_line") %>% 
  select(-route)

A_line = filter(subway_reformat, subway_line == "A")
A_line_compliant = filter(A_line, ada == "TRUE")
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train, in which 17 are ADA
compliant.

## Problem 3

Read in pols month dataset.

``` r
library(lubridate)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'lubridate'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     date, intersect, setdiff, union

``` r
poll = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  relocate(prez_dem, .after = prez_gop) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    prez_gop:prez_dem,
    names_to = "prez",
    values_to = "president"
  ) %>% 
  select(-c(prez, day))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Read in snp dataset

``` r
standard_and_poor = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Separate date in snp dataset

``` r
standard_and_poor$date = as.Date(standard_and_poor$date, "%m/%d/%Y")
```

``` r
new_snp = 
  standard_and_poor %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")
```

Clean unemployment dataset

``` r
unemployment_data = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "number_of_unemployment"
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join snp into pols

``` r
fas_df = 
  left_join(new_snp, poll, by = c("year", "month"))
```
