This is my solution to HW1.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 2

Read in the subway dataset and some brief cleaning

``` r
subway_data = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-(ada_notes:entrance_location))  %>% 
  select(-c("division", "exit_only", "staffing", "staff_hours", "vending")) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, `YES` = "TRUE", `NO` = "FALSE"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

After some brief cleaning, the data contains subway line, station name,
station latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance
type, and ADA compliance. `select` function was used to remove the
columns after ADA. `select` was then used a gain to remove some
unneccessary columns. `mutate` function was used to change from
character variable to logical variable.

The resulting dataset is a tibble of 18 columns and 1,868 rows (1,868 x
18)
